Go language package for managing playing cards.

## Apologia Pro Vita Sua
I'm creating this package for use in my [arachne project](https://github.com/dougfort/arachne)

I'm sure there a are existing packages better suited to this purpose, but I'm
going to ahead anyway for these reasons:

1. It's my precious.
2. I want a representation I can use in programs that act as players
3. Almost all the code I've written is in [SpiderOak Repositories](https://github.com/SpiderOak)
   This package is something I can show potential employers.
4. Related to that: this is my place to show the way I think Go should be written.

## Work in Progress

This is a work in progress. The API is version 0.0.1. I intend to make breaking
changes without regard to existing code.

Of course, if someone out there actually wants to use this package, I'm willing
to negotiate any changes.
